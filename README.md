# Data Structure

Data structures are written in Python3. You can find the most common structures, 
with a friendly CLI for each one. The structures are separated into 
packages that allow you to use/include it for your particular purpose.

## Trees

The tree structures are under the **trees** directory. To use the interactive
CLI, you need to run:

```python
python3 cli_tree.py
```

## Linked list

CLI, you need to run:
